## Get Started.

1. download this R script "run_analysis.R" into your workspace (working directory)
2. create a directory named "dataset"
3. put your data in "dataset" directory
4. in "dataset" directory, there should be file:

The dataset includes the following files:

* 'README.txt'
* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.


## How does this R script work

  You could run the R script "run_analysis.R" that will does the following. 

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
